<p style="column-count:3;word-spacing:3px;line-height:1.8">Goa is a state in India within the coastal region known as the Konkan in India. It is bounded by Maharashtra to the north and Karnataka to the east and south, with the Arabian Sea forming its Western coast. It is India's smallest state by area and the fourth smallest by population. Goa has the highest GDP per capita among all Indian states, that is two and a half times that of the country.[3] It was ranked the best placed state by the "Eleventh Finance Commission" for its infrastructure and ranked on top for the best quality of life in India by the National Commission on Population based on the 12 Indicators
<br><br>
Panaji is the state's capital, while Vasco da Gama is its largest city. The historic city of Margao still exhibits the cultural influence of the Portuguese, who first landed in the early 16th century as merchants and conquered it soon thereafter. Goa is a former Portuguese province; the Portuguese overseas territory of Portuguese India existed for about 450 years until it was annexed by India in 1961.
Goa is visited by large numbers of international and domestic tourists each year for its beaches, places of worship and world heritage architecture. It has rich flora and fauna, owing to its location on the Western Ghats range, a biodiversity hotspot. </p>

<h3>Location</h3>
<p>The location of Goa makes it easily accessible. Travelling to Goa, the best tourist place for India is comfortable. Situated on the western coastline of India, the Union Territory of Goa is sandwiched between the states of Maharashtra and Karnataka. The capital Panaji is at a distance of 592 km from Bangalore and 593 km from Mumbai. The waters of the Arabian Sea wash the coastline of Goa. It is split into two districts-North Goa (STD Code: 0832) and South Goa (STD Code: 0834). North Goa includes the capital city of Panjim, the former capital of Old Goa, Fort Aguada and Candolim, Chapora, Vagator, and the beaches Calangute, Anjuna, and Baga. South Goa includes Vasco da Gama Bogmalo, Margao, Colva and Benolem. Being near to the sea, Goa enjoys a maritime climate, with April and May being very hot. The Goa Beach Resorts sitauted on the beach sides are the best way to enjoy Goa. Christian Pilgrimage tours to Goa are usually taken up around the Christmas and New Year.</p>

<h3>Fairs & Festivals</h3>
<p>Being a predominantly Roman Catholic society, most of the festivals of Goa are Christianity-specific. Feast days, thanksgiving, monsoon celebrations, processions-all mark the Goanese calendar. Shigmo, the Goanese version of Holi, is celebrated in the month of February and March. The Feast of Our Lady of Miracles, celebrated 16 days after the Easter, is secular by nature and is celebrated with pomp and show by both Hindus and Christians. Igitun Chalne, held at Sirigao temple in Bicholim during May, is one of Goa's most distinctive festivals. The main attraction of the festival comes when devotees of Goddess Lairaya walk across burning coals to prove their devotion. The Feast of St. Anthony in the month of June is also significant as it marks the beginning of monsoon. Besides such religious festivals, Goa is also known for its arts and crafts fairs, and food festivals.</p>

<h3>Tourist Attractions</h3>
<p>Goa, the best tourist place for India offers several tourist attractions. Beaches and churches are the key tourist attractions in Goa. Christian Pilgrimage tours and Goan Carnival attract numerous visitors. In the local dialect, Goa is often referred to as "Goa Dourada," (meaning "Golden Goa") because of its beaches, forts, churches, Waterfalls, seminaries, and Caves.
