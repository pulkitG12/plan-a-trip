<p style="column-count:3;word-spacing:3px;line-height:1.8">Kerala, a state on India's tropical Malabar Coast, has nearly 600km of Arabian Sea shoreline. It's known for its palm-lined beaches and backwaters, a network of canals. Inland are the Western Ghats, mountains whose slopes support tea, coffee and spice plantations as well as wildlife. National parks like Eravikulam and Periyar, plus Wayanad and other sanctuaries, are home to elephants, langur monkeys and tigers.
<br><br>
For many travellers, Kerala is South India's most serenely beautiful state. A slender coastal strip is shaped by its layered landscape: almost 600km of glorious Arabian Sea coast and beaches; a languid network of glistening backwaters; and the spice- and tea-covered hills of the Western Ghats. Just setting foot on this swath of soul-quenching, palm-shaded green will slow your subcontinental stride to a blissed-out amble. Kerala is a world away from the frenzy of elsewhere, as if India had passed through the Looking Glass and become an altogether more laid-back place.

Besides its famous backwaters, elegant houseboats, ayurvedic treatments and delicately spiced, taste-bud-tingling cuisine, Kerala is home to wild elephants, exotic birds and the odd tiger, while vibrant traditions such as Kathakali plays, temple festivals and snake-boat races frequently bring even the smallest villages to life. It's hard to deny Kerala's liberal use of the slogan 'God's Own Country'.

<h3>Fairs & Festivals</h3>
<p>Onam is a time for sports and festivities and in Kerala-where one third of the area is low lying, covered with canals, lakes, and backwaters-the people take to their boats and country crafts to celebrate.

Colourful aquatic festivals are organized along the sacred rive Pampa. Depending on the positioning of the stars and the moon, the festival is held at the end of August or beginning of September.

Christmas is another festival that is celebrated with much vigour and enthusiasm in the state. Other important festivals of the state are Eid, Muharram, and other festivals that are traditionally celebrated all over the country.</p>

<h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
<p>The climate of the state, as in the most of the other part of India, is tropical. The summer comes to the state in April and continues for the next four months. The maximum temperature during this season is around 33°C. Monsoon touches the state in June and remains there till September though not much difference in temperature can be felt. Winter is from October to January and temperature drops a bit. The weather is never too chilly in Kerala.</p>
<h3>Tourist Attractions</h3>
<p>The entire state of Kerala is a tourist destination and at every corner of this state, one can experience something new. It is not without any reason that the Keralites call their state the 'God's Own Country'. Backwaters, historical structures, culture, wildlife, and natural beauty, the state has all these and more.

The major tourist destinations in the state include Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, Kovalam, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Munnar, Palakkad, Alappuzha, Kollam, Kannur, Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary, and Sabrimalai etc.

The state has given great emphasis on eco tourism and new experiments are being done to take tourism nearer to the general public. In this way too, the state is a pioneer in the state.</p>
